# Text Detection and Recognition System

Constructed an end-to-end OCR pipeline using the EAST model for text detection and a custom CRNN trained on the MJSynth dataset for recognition, achieving **95% detection accuracy** and processing text at **20 FPS** during live testing.

## Features
- Text detection using EAST model
- Text recognition using custom CRNN
- Real-time processing via OpenCV
- Edge-device deployment ready

## Installation 
**bash**
pip install -r requirements.txt
